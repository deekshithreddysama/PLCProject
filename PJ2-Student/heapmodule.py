"""The program's heap is currently a dictionary that maps handles to namespaces.

      heap : { (HANDLE : NAMESPACE)+ }
             where  HANDLE = a string of digits
                    NAMESPACE = a dictionary that maps var names to ints:
                                { (ID : INT)* }
   Example:
     heap = { "h0": {"x":7, "y":1, "z":2} }
     heap_count = 1
        is an example heap, where handle "0" names a namespace
        whose  "x"  field holds int 7, "y" field holds int 1,
        and "z" holds int 2.

===========================================================================
   You will extend this simple definition when you implement closures,
   the activation stack, and objects:

      heap : { (HANDLE : (NAMESPACE | CLOSURE))+ }
          where  HANDLE = a string, e.g.,  'h1'
                 NAMESPACE = a dictionary that maps var names to ints or to handles.  Also contains a "parentns" link to more-global vars.
                 CLOSURE = a dictionary containing a procedure's formal parameters, local decls, code body, and handle to the proc's global namespace
   Example:
     heap = { "h0": {"x":7, "y":1, "z":2, "p": 'h1', "parentns":'nil'},
              "h1": {"type":'proc', "params":['a'], "locals":[], "code":[['print', 'a']], "link":'h0'}
            }

        is an example heap, where handle "h0" names a namespace
        whose  "x"  field holds int 7, "y" field holds int 1,
        "z" holds int 2, and 'p' holds a handle to a closure saved at 'h1'.
